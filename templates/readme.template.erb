### Guidelines for submitting stories for <%= @name.split('_').join(' ').capitalize %>

The prompt for writing this story is located [here](../../spec/prompts/<%= @name %>_spec.rb).

To submit a story, simply create a new .txt file in this folder, like "my_little_pony.txt". Write your story
in that file, and then run `rspec` from the command line anywhere in the project, to see if it passes spec.

Once you're ready to submit, submit a pull request containing your new story.
(More details on how to do this can be found [here](../../README.md).)

Happy writing!
