### Guidelines for submitting stories for <%= @name.capitalize %>

To submit a story, simply create a new .txt file in this folder, like "my_little_pony.txt". Write your story
in that file, and then run `rspec` from the command line anywhere in the project, to see if it passes spec.

Once you're ready to submit, submit a pull request containing your new story. (More details on how to do this
can be found [here](./README.md).)

Happy writing!
